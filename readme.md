# spkcli.sh

## Features

* Common aliases
* Publish in container or via GitHub (requires gh cli)
* Test script (alpha)
  * Caveat: Packages with wizards will fail to install if they han't been designed with empty/defaults input
* Update script (beta)


## Usage

1. Copy the files to the root of the spksrc reposetory:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/publicarray/spkcli/main/spkcli.sh; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/publicarray/spkcli/main/test; printf "SSH_HOST=\"dsm7-dev\"\nSSH_PASS=\"\"" > .env
```
Note: you may want to update your `~/.ssh/config` to include your NAS as an alias: e.g
```
Host dsm7-dev
   HostName 10.0.0.3
   User admin
```

3. Update the `.env` file

```
./spkcli [COMMAND]
    build [SPK] {ARCH}      build packages for development (x64-7.0)
    clean [SPK]             clean package
    clean-all               clean all builds and cached files in /distrib
    digest [SPK]            update digests
    lint                    run make lint
    publish [SPK] {ARCH}    build and publish for all DSM architectures
    publish-ci [SPK] true   build and publish for all supported DSM versions/architectures using GitHub Actions
    pull                    git pull & docker image pull
    run                     run container for development
    test [SPK FILE] [SPK]   run test script on NAS via ssh
    update [SPK]            check for git releases for an update
```
